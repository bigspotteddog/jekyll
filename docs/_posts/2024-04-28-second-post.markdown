This is the second post of this blog. It is a totally free blog which is great. It was complicated to set up and I do not think a non-technical person could do it easily.

I want to see how this post is represented and if it is purely added during the run of the github action for pages. I would also like to see how the templates work. I see the `_config.yml` file and it probably refers to which template to use. Again, not something that is very non-tech friendly.

So, the plan is to make something much more non-tech friendly and to make it accessible. I will use GitHub pages to keep it free. To make it available over the internet we might charge a small fee of tiers starting at $3 per month with limits.

Let's see what this looks like.
